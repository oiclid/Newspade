# Newspade
alright Documentation time.

The main purpose of this documentation is to give developers a chance to add their own scrapers an successfully run them in production time.
Please note that due to this I will only cover the code hosted on the mysites app. However i will give a quick recap on the articles application towards the end of this documentation.


Installation.
------------
for installing this application just clone this application with ::

    git clone "https://github.com/cmwaura/Newspade.git"
then cd into the root directory::
    
    cd analyst
    
Requirements needed for the project
-------------------------------------------

you will need the python2.7 interpreter and pip installed in the computer. you will also need the virtualenv or virtualenv wrapper installed in your computer and activated to create your env.
All the requirements have been added on the requirements.txt file in the project. Once you have the project simply::

     pip install -r requirements.txt

and all the requirements will be installed for you. For people using a Linux distro this should be enough for you. However
for people using windows you will need an extra addition of [pywin32.exe](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/). Install it to your local drive then use easy_install to add it to your environment::
 
    easy_install C:\>path\to\your\pywin32\install

The next few steps from here will be the usual django steps where you prepare the database and create a super user.

    #prepare the db with sqlite3
    python manage.py migrate
    #prepare the superuser.
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    # finally this last step will be for collecting the static files.
    python manage.py collectstatic.
    
One you have done all this just run the server and go to http://127.0.0.1:800/admin and log in and you are good to go for the main steps.

Mysites Application.
--------------------
##### 1) Dynamic_Scraper Settings:

If you got to this point, there are a few things that you have have noticed on the console the Dynamic Scraper application. This is the first portion of actually running the spiders. In order to start the process click on "Scraper object classes" then add an object class.
In this example i will use the "data_obj_bbc" class.

Once you have given the object class a name(data_obj_bbc) then scroll down and you will find a section called scraped obj attrs as show 
below

Inorder to understand this step i will refer you to the actual code that represents the next few steps:
open mysites/models.py and you will find this code::

    class NewsWebsite(models.Model):
      	'''
      	in this situation this is the news website that we will be scraping from. So for instance if we are looking for all 
      	the business analyst postions from indeed.com this particular django models wll specify what website is nessecary for
      	which particular Article. 
      	It borrows from thenm django class models.Model to do the job.
      	The scraper variable is the actual scraper that will borrow from the dynamic_scraper modules and is responsible 
      	for using scrapy functions to scrape whatever website we desire.
      	The scraper_runtime is as the title suggest. It borrows from the SchedulerRuntime class of the dynamic_scraper modulesd
      	'''

      	title = models.CharField(max_length=250)
      	url = models.URLField()
      	scraper = models.ForeignKey(Scraper, blank= True, null=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL)
    	  scraper_runtime = models.ForeignKey(SchedulerRuntime, blank= True, null=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL)



    class BBCNews(models.Model):
      	'''
      	This particular class is concerned with receiving all the scraped material once the job is done. For instance if we are scraping 
      	business analyst positions from a company in mountain view then what we expect is that:
      	title = "Donald Trump wins the Primaries only to be dumped by republicans"
      	url = www.company.com/news.html (or something similar)
      	description = Description|truncated.
      	'''
      
      	news_website = models.ForeignKey(NewsWebsite)
      	checker_runtime = models.ForeignKey(SchedulerRuntime, blank= True, null=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL)
      	title = models.CharField(max_length=250)
      	url = models.URLField()
      	description = models.TextField(blank=True)
      	date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
      	company = models.CharField(default="BBC News", max_length=100)

This code is what we are working with more specifically the BBC News. Now back to the admin page, in the Scraped obj attrs, add the following under the name section 
  I) Base:
  The base is essential an nessecary for the spider to run. Think of the base as the core html that the spider will identify inorder to 
  take the elements from that particular core. So for instance, if we are working with scrapy and we have need to get a news website with a html tree of::
      
      <div class= "yellow">
        <ol>
          <li id= "name"> yellow</li>
          <li id="description"> Yellow is a colow</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    
  the base class will be the
  
        <div class="yellow">
  This is what the spider will be looking for.The order type of this name is 10 and the Attr type will be BASE.
  
  II) title:
  this is from the BBCNews models and in actual fact the rest will all be from the BBCNews models.
  Order = 20
  Attr type = STANDARD
  
  III) url:
  Order = 30
  Attr type = STANDARD OR DETAIL_PAGE_URL
  * one thing to consider is that you want the id field of the url to be true. This is because it will be used to determine the uniqueness of each individual post. It comes from the logic that no two posts have the same link and if we have an entry like that, then one is a repeat of the other and the spider will delete the former.
  
 IV) Description:
  Order = 40
  Attr type = STANDARD

One last thing to note is that company is a default value so we do not need to add it as an object class. The BBC company will be automatically added. Similar to that, the date is the date the scraper will be run and that too is automatic.

Save that bad boy and we are onto the next challenge.
